			My first language is C++, which I love because learning it teaches a lot about the inner workings of computers, as well as how to represent and handle any real life object in your program. I've also had classes in school that used Fortran and Matlab, and I've taken time on my own to dabble with c#, Java, Ruby, html, css, and Javascript. Programming is such a blast because it allows you to build from scratch almost anything you can imagine,
