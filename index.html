    <h1><span>About Me</span></h1>
    <p>
      Hey! I'm <strong>Justin</strong>. I love all things science and outdoors. I studied physics at
      Utah State University where I received my Master's degree in 2017. I chose  this field because 
      I wanted to learn about everything from the small particles we're all made out of, to the 
      planets, stars, and gallaxies hurling around our universe, and everything inbetween. Along 
      the way,  I've learned a lot about programming in order to extract intriguing information from 
      huge heaps of data, as well as to streamline repetetive processes to make life easier for me 
      and my fellow researchers.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first language is C++, which I love because learning it teaches a lot about the inner  
      workings of computers, as well as how to represent and handle any real life object in your 
      program. I've also had classes in school that used Fortran and Matlab, and I've taken time
      on my own to dable with c#, Java, Ruby, html, css, and Javascript. Programming is such a blast
      because it allows you to build from scratch almost anything you can imagine,
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When I'm not being a geeky nerd (honestly, this never happens.) I enjoy hiking,
      camping, snowboarding, woodwork, or playing music (mostly on the piano). I have 
      a beautiful wife of five years and a cute dog who both love to go on adventures
      with me. 
    </p>
