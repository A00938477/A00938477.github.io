			Computer programming is one of the most important tools for any 
			scientist. My first language is C++, which I loved learning because 
			it taught a lot about the inner workings of computers, as well as 
			how to represent and model real life objects by combining simple data 
			structures together. I have also taken classes in school that used 
			Fortran, Matlab, and Mathcad. On my own time I have dabbled with c#,
			Qt, Java, html, css, and Javascript. 
			<br /> <br />
			The projects listed on this page are ones I did either during my 
			education, or as side projects just for fun.
			<br /> <br />
			Some other  programming projects I have worked on were related to 
			my research. Follow the "Research" link at the top of the page to 
			see more examples of these projects.
